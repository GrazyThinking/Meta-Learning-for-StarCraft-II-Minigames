Include here any information that we use for the project: papers, tutorial links (directly in this readme), etc.

# Useful links:

## SC2LE:

- [Main SC2LE repo (DeepMind)](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2)
- [Good resources on SC2LE including a setup tutorial (Niels Justesen)](https://njustesen.com/)
- [A student project on SC2 (Telecom BCN)](https://github.com/telecombcn-dl/2017-dlai-team5)
- [A tutorial on creating a scripted bot (iDTechHub)](https://github.com/iDTechHub/SC2LE)
- [An unofficial implementation of the RL agents described in the SC2LE paper (Xhu Joy)](https://github.com/xhujoy/pysc2-agents)
- [A discord group for people working on SC2LE](https://discord.gg/vEZmYqB)

Note that the team from Telecom BCN actually used two already existing implementations of A3C for SC2, [this one (Xhu Joy)](https://github.com/xhujoy/pysc2-agents) and [this one (greentfrapp)](https://github.com/greentfrapp/pysc2-RLagents). The second one heavily relies on the work of Arthur Juliani who implemented A3C for the game Doom.
