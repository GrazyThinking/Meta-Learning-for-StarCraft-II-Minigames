## Implementations of A3C for SC2:
- [(greetfrapp) An clean implementation based on the work of Arthur Juliani who implemented A3C for the game Doom](https://github.com/greentfrapp/pysc2-RLagents)
- [(xhujoy) Another implementation](https://github.com/xhujoy/pysc2-agents)
- [(telecombcn) A student project on SC2 (Telecom BCN) that wraps the two implementations above](https://github.com/telecombcn-dl/2017-dlai-team5)

## Other RL agents implemented for SC2:
- [(peekalto) A2C (synchronous version of A3C), and PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)](https://github.com/pekaalto/sc2aibot)
- [(vwxyzjn) PPO using OpenAI Gym (with sc2gym) and Tensorfoce for a cleaner and more modular implementation](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/SC2AI)
- [(chris-chris) DQN and A2C](https://github.com/chris-chris/pysc2-examples)
